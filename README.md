# Shift Cipher
> Shift Cipher takes a plain text message and shifts each letter forward in the alphabet by a given number. For example, a shift cipher with a shift of 1 would turn the string 'hello' to 'ifmmp'. 

Create a class ShiftCipher that takes the numerical value of the shift as a constructor parameter. The class should have two methods:

- encrypt: takes a plain text string and returns a capitalized string with each letter shifted forward in the alphabet based on the set shift value.
- decrypt: takes an encrypted message and returns a lower case string with each letter shifted back in the alphabet based on the set shift value.
- In both methods, any character outside the alphabet should remain the same.
- But if a character is shifted outside the alphabet in either direction it should be wrapped around to the other side. For example, encrypting a y with a shift of 4 results in C and decrypting an A with a shift of 1 result in z.
